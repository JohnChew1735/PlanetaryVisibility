# 🌌 Planetary Weather & Astronomy Data Visualizer

This project provides tools to retrieve, visualize, and compare planetary weather data (Earth & Mars) as well as NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD). It supports automated data fetching, custom user uploads, and graphical representations using Python and PHP.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔭 APOD/

- **APOD.php**: Allows user to input a specific date and retrieve the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) for that date.
- **moreAPOD.php**: Fetches APODs over a date range (from start date to end date).

### 🖼 APOD_images/

- Stores images retrieved from APOD API when APOD.php or moreAPOD.php is run.

---

### 🌍 Earth/

- **earth.php**: Retrieves and stores current weather data for Earth (e.g., Selangor).

### 🔴 Mars/

- **mars.php**: Retrieves and stores current weather data for Mars from NASA's InSight API or related datasets.

---

### 📊 Comparison/

- **comparison.py**: Reads CSV files from the `Comparison_csv` folder and plots comparisons (e.g., temperature, pressure, wind speed) between Earth and Mars.
- **comparison_images/**: Stores the output comparison graphs generated by `comparison.py`.

---

### 📂 Comparison_csv/

- Contains the weather data in CSV format for both Earth and Mars:
  - `earth_weather.csv`
  - `mars_weather.csv`

---

### 🧑‍🚀 userUpload/

- **userUpload.php**: Command-line PHP script that prompts the user to input custom planetary data (pressure, temperature, wind) for two planets. Input is validated before being passed for graph plotting.
- **user_plot.py**: Python script that reads the data passed by `userUpload.php` and generates a bar chart comparing the two planets' weather stats.

## 🛠 Dependencies

- **PHP** (for data input and API calls)
- **Python 3**
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`

Make sure these Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
